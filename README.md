# Calorie_Prediction_ML
This Machine Learning Model estimate calories burnt during physical activity, incorporating factors like gender, age, height, weight, duration, heart rate, and body temperature. 
After rigorous experimentation, I've developed two models using linear regression and XGBoost algorithms. And the Calorie_outlier contains the same linear regression model after removing all the outliers using InterQuartile Range method.
